## A Business-Facing CMS

### The Problem

Stems currently maintains a large amount of client information in physical files. This not only presents various business continuity concerns, but it also leaves the infomation in a static, unsearchable format. 

At the end of each day, employees turn in what are called Green Sheets. These sheets contain information about client properties which the office then uses for billing and account maintenance. The aim of this application is to provide a paperless approach to manage client information and to communicate with employees while out in the field.

### The Solution

Through a mobile-first development approach, this new application solves many of Stem's problems and also provides a launching pad for future development.

With this new tool, employees no longer need to hand in physical sheets of paper after each client visit. After completing their tasks, they can submit updates to the office manager in real-time. Ultimately, this will help the business more efficiently manage their time and resources.

Currently, there are three main parts. The **Client List** section shows the current list of Stems clients and allows users to add or delete them.

The **Client Profile** section shows an individual client and their information. If notes need to be added, employees can submit them in real-time. 

The **To-Do** section shows an active list of the open activities to be completed.

## Future Plans

Several features will be added to this web application in the future, including client appointment tracking/scheduling, invoice/billing features, and individual employee profiles that include the employee's hourly billing rate.
